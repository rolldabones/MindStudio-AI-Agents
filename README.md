# MindStudio-AI-Agents

## What MindStudio is
MindStudio is a no-code AI agent platform that lets users design, deploy, and manage AI-driven applications and automations through an intuitive visual editor. It coordinates multiple large language and multimodal models without programming or separate API keys. It focuses on translating business logic into robust, end-to-end workflows that can interpret and act on documents and other inputs, connect to external tools and platforms, and deliver results as web applications, browser extensions, API endpoints, or background automations. It also includes governance features that support human oversight and team collaboration.
